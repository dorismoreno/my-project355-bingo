    <h1>History</h1>
    <p>In the United States, Bingo is a game of chance in which each player matches numbers printed in different arrangements on cards with the numbers the game host (caller) 
      draws at random, marking the selected numbers with tiles. When a player finds the selected numbers are arranged on their card in a row, they call out "Bingo!" to alert all
       participants to a winning card, which prompts the game host (or an associate assisting the host) to examine the card for verification of the win. Players compete against 
       one another to be the first to have a winning arrangement for the prize or jackpot. After a winner is declared, the players clear their number cards of the tiles and the 
       game host begins a new round of play.
       Alternative methods of play try to increase participation by creating excitement. Since its invention in 1929, modern bingo has evolved into multiple variations, with each 
      jurisdiction's gambling laws regulating how the game is played. There are also nearly unlimited patterns that may be specified for play. Some games require only one number
      to be matched, while cover-all games award the jackpot for covering an entire card. There are even games that award prizes to players for matching no numbers or achieving 
      no pattern.</p>
